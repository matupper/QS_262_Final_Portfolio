 Final Portfolio Website for Intro To Queer Studies
 Matias Tupper - 3/20/2024

 Reflection:
Creating this website for our Queer Studies class has been an enlightening and empowering experience. As I delved into the content creation process, I gained a deeper understanding of the rich history, ongoing struggles, and diverse experiences within the LGBTQ+ community.

One aspect of the project that stood out to me was the opportunity to curate resources for the "Taking Action" section. It was inspiring to discover the multitude of ways in which individuals can actively support LGBTQ+ rights and foster inclusivity in their communities. From advocacy organizations to volunteer opportunities, there are numerous avenues for making a positive impact and effecting change.

Additionally, researching and compiling the History segment highlighted the resilience and courage of queer individuals throughout history. Learning about pivotal moments such as the Stonewall Riots and the AIDS crisis underscored the importance of understanding the struggles and triumphs that have shaped the LGBTQ+ movement.

Overall, this project has reinforced the significance of Queer Studies in education and society. By providing a platform to explore LGBTQ+ identities, histories, and activism, my website aims to promote awareness, empathy, and allyship. I hope that any visitors will find valuable resources and insights that inspire them to engage critically and compassionately with queer issues, both in and out of the classroom.
